domy.js
=======================================
Slim DOM-helper JavaScript library for modern browsers. Domy.js mirrors most of jQuery's core methods, except it does not support older browsers.

Why?
----
This library was created while developing extensions for Google Chrome, because including the full jQuery library felt like a waste when I would not need most of the features and the cross-browser support it offers. Domy.js only have the most basic utilities and use the latest DOM API to keep the code small.

Support
-------
Latest version of the browsers below are supported.

- Google Chrome
- Firefox
- Opera
